Project description: This main goal of this project was to insert semantic actions 
into the parser in order to evaluate the expressions:{x + y,
x − y, x ∗ y, x/y, x//y, x%y, x∗∗e, (x), −x, +x}. The goal of this project was to use an OO solution to do this. The OO way of solving this problem with an abstract syntax tree, while at first has a few difficulties to solve, in the end provides a robust solution to handle the requirements of this project and the last one to come.

Difficulties: Fun project, once it's working. It drove me a little crazy tracking down the bugs betweent the parser and my C++ code.

Working:
		basic scope
		nested scope
		return

Not working well:
		I'm pretty sure I need to peruse the code in order to get rid of a few more memory leaks... I got rid of some, but I think I left some still.
